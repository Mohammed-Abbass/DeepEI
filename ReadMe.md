## DeepEI

This is the repository of codes for the paper entitled "[Predicting molecular fingerprint from electronâˆ’ionization mass spectrum with deep neural networks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.017137v1)" (submit). This repository only contains the source codes without any data or pretrained models, due to the models were trained by NIST dataset.

### Data preprocess

Data preprocess scripts are used for extracting compound information of NIST into numpy object. They are included in the *scripts/read.py* , including gathering the SMILES, exact masses, retention indices, Morgan fingerprints, molecular descriptors and mass spectra.

### Training the model

DeepEI contain two main parts of models: 1. Predicting molecular fingerprint from EI-MS (*Fingerprint* folder); 2. Predicting retention index from structure (*retention* folder). Each folder contains the codes for data pretreatment, model training and model selection. For FP prediction, we compared for models, which are MLP, XGBoost, LR and PLS-DA. For RI prediction, we compared single-channel CNN, multi-channel CNN and MLP.

### Prediction

The main functions of predication are included in the *DeepEI* folder. *predict_RI* function takes SMILES as input and predicts the corresponding retention index. *predict_fingerprint* function takes mass spectrum as input and predicts the corresponding fingerprints. 

### Comparison

the *Discussion* folder contains the scripts for evaluating the identification performance, and comparing with [NEIMS](https://github.com/brain-research/deep-molecular-massspec) package. The corresponding results are also included. We compared DeepEI, NEIMS and their combination.
